      # The default size of 5Gi is fairly small. With 1000 namespaces and
      # at least 5 pods per namespace you could expect a few hundred Mb of
      # storage per week.
      # With multiple replicas, storage capacity is also increased.
      # Additionally, on many clouds, IOPS are provisioned based on disk
      # size, meaning a larger PVC can be faster.
