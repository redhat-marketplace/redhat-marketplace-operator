# IBM Data Reporter Operator

# Introduction

The IBM Data Reporter Operator accepts events and transforms them into reports submitted to the Data Service of the IBM Metrics Operator.

# Details

The IBM Data Reporter Operator deploys a service that exposes an endpoint to which callers can send raw json event data. The event data is transformed into a report and is sent to the IBM Data Service. The IBM Data Service periodically uploads the reports to Red Hat Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift Container Platform, major version 4 with any available supported minor version
- Install IBM Metrics Operator and Red Hat Marketplace Deployment Operator
  - IBM Data Reporter Operator prerequisties the IBM Metrics Operator data-service and registration with Red Hat Marketplace
  - Register the Cluster by creating a `redhat-marketplace-pull-secret`, as per the instructions
  - `rhm-data-service` has started

## SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

- The operator runs under Red Hat restricted SCC

## Resources Required

- The operator requires at least 85 Mi memory.

## Limitations

- Only runs on amd64, s390x and ppc64le architectures

## Installing

- A user with the cluster administrator role.
- Install this operator in the same namespace as the IBM Metrics Operator and Red Hat Marketplace Deployment Operator
  - default namespace: `redhat-marketplace`

## Upgrade Policy

The operator releases adhere to semantic versioning and provides a seamless upgrade path for minor and patch releases within the current stable channel.

# Configuration

Optional:
- Configure the DataReporterConfig named `datareporterconfig` as per the following example
- Reference the service account name that will be used to access the service
  - Reports generated for events sent by this user will be decorated with the additional metadata

```YAML
apiVersion: marketplace.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: DataReporterConfig
metadata:
  name: datareporterconfig
spec:
  userConfig:
  - metadata:
      ameta1: ametadata1
      bmeta1: bmetadata1
      cmeta1: cmetadata1
      dmeta1: dmetadata1
    userName: system:serviceaccount:redhat-marketplace:ibm-data-reporter-operator-api
```

### User Configuration

- The ClusterRole for api access is `clusterrole/ibm-data-reporter-operator-api`
- The default ServiceAccount provided as an api user is `system:serviceaccount:redhat-marketplace:ibm-data-reporter-operator-api`
  - The default ClusterRoleBinding for this user is `clusterrolebinding/ibm-data-reporter-operator-api`

Optional:

- To create an additional ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding for api access

```SHELL
NAMESPACE=$(oc config view --minify -o jsonpath='{..namespace}') && \
oc create serviceaccount my-api-service-account && \
oc create clusterrolebinding ibm-data-reporter-operator-api --clusterrole=ibm-data-reporter-operator-api --serviceaccount=${NAMESPACE}:my-api-service-account
```

- Update datareporterconfig to attach metadata to reports associated with this user

## Usage

- Get Token & Host

```SHELL
oc project redhat-marketplace
export DRTOKEN=$(oc create token ibm-data-reporter-operator-api --namespace redhat-marketplace --duration 1h)
export DRHOST=$(oc get route ibm-data-reporter --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
```

- Get the Status

```SHELL
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer ${DRTOKEN}" https://${DRHOST}/v1/status 
```

- Post an Event

```SHELL
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer ${DRTOKEN}" -X POST -d '{"event":"myevent"}' https://${DRHOST}/v1/event
```

## Storage

- The operator temporarily stores events in pod memory, and writes to the IBM Metrics Operator data-service, which requires a PersistentVolume
